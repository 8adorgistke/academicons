Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon was released on June 27, 2003. It was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, as it marked the first collaboration between Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor Khan, who were both rising stars at that time. The movie also had a lot of hype due to its lavish production and promotion. However, the movie failed to impress the critics, who criticized it for being too long, melodramatic and unrealistic. The movie also faced competition from other releases such as Qayamat: City Under Threat and Bhoot.
 
Despite the negative reviews, Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon was a hit at the box office. It collected over â¹41 crore in India and over â¹15 crore overseas. It was the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2003. The movie also won several awards and nominations, such as the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for K.S. Chithra, the IIFA Award for Best Choreography for Farah Khan and the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role for Abhishek Bachchan.
